# About
Hi! My name is Susanna Parham and Iâ€™m a high school senior taking Engineering II. I am taking this class because I'm interested in engineering and am planning to study civil engineering once I graduate. I chose engineering because I love solving problems, designing, and building things. This portfolio collects my projects and learning notes.
