# **Portfolio Project** 
## Project Overview
Our first project of the year in engineering two was to set up this page as a portfolio for recording our own projects that would be available to the general public. This site was created in VS code with a bit of python but mostly markdown. (For which I used a very handy cheatsheet linked below.) 

## Struggles and solutions 
I had previously learned python in a mostly creative environment and transfering that knowlege to a more technical use in the terminal was a bit of a challange, but after my teacher explained it mulitple times and I was able to think and work through it, I was able to adjust. Further complications included pages that failed to save after using the mac command resulting in a malfunctioning gitignore page. Once we figured out how to save the pages properly, that issue resolved itself. 

## Skills learned 

- using VS code, including the terminal and markdown pages 
- creating a page in VS code then launching it to github
- updating and pushing a page in VS code to the corresponding page in github 


## Markdown Cheatsheet 
[This](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) is the very helpful markdown cheat sheet I used to help me create this page.
