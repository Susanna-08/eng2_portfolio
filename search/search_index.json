Further complications included pages that failed to save after using the mac command resulting in a malfunctioning gitignore page.

Using uv really ismplifies the process and makes things easier. These are some of the commands I used:</p> <p><code>uv pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material</code> This command was the first I used and it installed mkdocs into the uv's environment. Next I initialized my start mkdocs site with <code>uv run mkdocs new .</code> To push my code to build my site, and to update it when I make changes, I use <code>uv run mkdocs gh-deploy</code>. This is by far the string of code I use most often for my portoflio.  Using <code>uv run mkdocs serve</code> allows you to see a quick, local preview of your site. </p>"},{"location":"projects/uv_pip/#pip","title":"pip","text":"<p>Pip runs a lot slower and with more commands than uv.
