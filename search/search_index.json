My name is Susanna Parham and I\u2019m a high school senior taking Engineering II. I am taking this class because I'm interested in engineering and am planning to study civil engineering once I graduate. I chose engineering because I love solving problems, designing, and building things.

This site was created in VS code with a bit of python but mostly markdown.

Further complications included pages that failed to save after using the mac command resulting in a malfunctioning gitignore page. Once we figured out how to save the pages properly, that issue resolved itself. </p>"},{"location":"portfolio_project/#skills-learned","title":"Skills learned","text":"<ul> <li>using VS code, including the terminal and markdown pages </li> <li>creating a page in VS code then launching it to github</li> <li>updating and pushing a page in VS code to the corresponding page in github </li> </ul>"},{"location":"portfolio_project/#markdown-cheatsheet","title":"Markdown Cheatsheet","text":"<p>This is the very helpful [markdown] (https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) cheat sheet I used to help me create this page. </p>"},{"location":"projects/hello/","title":"Hello Project","text":"<p>This is a simple placeholder project page.
