Further complications included pages that failed to save after using the mac command resulting in a malfunctioning gitignore page.

However, uv is not supported everywhere and so it is useful to know pip. This is a rundown of what I did and learned:</p> <pre><code>mkdir project # creates a folder\n\ncd project # navigates into that folder\n\npython -m venv .venv # creates a virtual environment\n\nsource .venv/bin/activate # activates and enters the vitrtual environement on a mac\n\npip install (your choice of library) # installs your choice of python libraries\n\npython main.py # run virtual environment\n</code></pre> <p>Next, to clone a repo onto your comuputer you can do </p> <pre><code>git clone (link of the repo) # reate the folder with the repo\ncd (repo name) #navigate into repo\n</code></pre> <p>Then if you are using uv you can sync it with a simple line of code: </p> <pre><code>uv sync\n</code></pre> <p>However, with pip, you have to go through the process of creating and activating a virtual enviornment. The good news is that instead of adding each library indicidually, most projects have a requiremnets file which you can make use of like this:</p> <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt\n</code></pre>"}]}
